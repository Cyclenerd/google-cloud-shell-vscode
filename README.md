```

## Why

Why..? You may ask..: "For me, the standard looks exactly the same, doesn't it?"

![Screenshot: Theia vs. VS Code](./img/theia_vs_code.jpg)

The default editor is [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/), and it's definitely an excellent product.

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/cloud-ide-history) writes about this topic in their blog:

> To convince developers to say goodbye to local development, it is important to not reinvent the wheel but offer an editing experience that:
>
> * Is backed by a thriving community
> * Wins hearts and minds of developers
> * Works on modern web technology
>
> This is VS Code.

My developer heart is set on VS Code üßë‚Äçüíªüíò.
I don't want to miss the marketplace and the VS Code extensions.
I also like the 160px more vertical space for the source code.

If you feel the same way, this project with the script will help you.
If you get along with Theia, also good.
This is diversity.

If you rely on [Cloud Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GoogleCloudTools.cloudcode), please support this [issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-code-vscode/issues/256).
Google unfortunately does not publish to the vendor neutral, Open Source marketplace for VS Code [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/).
